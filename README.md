# About

This repository will host all the projects I'm working on during my way through the Data Science curriculum. My intention here is to share what I'm learning and help others that are attempting to follow the same path.

Besides the projects, I intend to share some references and materials I'm using to support the learning process. That will include free and paid materials and also some notes I should take to help me through the way.

A special mention goes to [@carlosfab](https://github.com/carlosfab) whose course "Data Science na Pr√°tica" was the inspiration to this repository. For now, the course is available only in Portuguese but it was one of the best materials I found, not only because of the technical part but also the insights to build a successful career in data science.
